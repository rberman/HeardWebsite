                        and that report can help others avoid dangerous areas and see sexism in their communities.

            <em>
                Heard maps instances of verbal, physical, and systemic sexism to raise awareness of the harsh realities that women face every day.
                By recording instances of sexism that go ignored and unreported, we aim to change attitudes towards sexism.
                Where women once ignored or silently accepted sexism, now they can stand up and speak out.
